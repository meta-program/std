**1. Key Aspects of Sintering and Phase Transformation in NiTi:**

*   **Sintering Temperature and Holding Time:** These are paramount. The sintering temperature must be high enough to facilitate diffusion and phase formation but not so high as to cause excessive grain growth, porosity, or the formation of undesired phases[4][19]. For instance, sintering NiTi at 900°C for 2 hours results in a porous structure with a porosity of 53.6%, compressive strength of 173.7 MPa, and elastic modulus of 4.2 GPa, with phases primarily composed of TiNi, Ti2Ni, and TiNi3[19]. Sintering at 1373 K (approximately 1100°C) allows for the observation of eutectoid decomposition of NiTi at around 847 K and 823 K for Ni/Ti and Ni/TiH2 compacts, respectively, during furnace cooling[15]. The holding time at the sintering temperature also significantly impacts the phase transformation. Longer holding times allow for more complete reactions and homogenization[4]. For example, the quantity of NiTi2 and Ni3Ti phases in NiTi alloys decreases with increased sintering time, although they are not completely eliminated[4].

*   **Heating Rate:** The rate at which the temperature is increased to the sintering temperature can influence the phase transformation. A slower heating rate allows for better control of the reactions and can help prevent the formation of unwanted phases[20]. For instance, a ramp rate of up to about 25°C/min is used for sintering Ni—Ti-RE alloys[20].

*   **Cooling Rate:** The rate at which the sintered material is cooled can also affect the phase transformation. Faster cooling rates can lead to the formation of metastable phases or suppress certain transformations[15][16]. In situ neutron diffraction studies have shown that the intensities of the B2-NiTi reflections decrease during the holding stage at 1373 K (1100°C), which has been elaborated as an extinction effect according to the dynamical theory of neutron diffraction, when distorted crystallites gradually recover to perfect crystals[16].

*   **Starting Materials:** The choice of starting materials, whether elemental powders (Ni and Ti) or pre-alloyed NiTi powders, can significantly impact the sintering process and the resulting phase transformation[15][17]. The use of TiH2 powder in titanium and its alloys sintering has been receiving increasing interest[24]. The dehydrogenation of TiH2 significantly affects the sintering behavior and resultant microstructure[15]. In comparison to the Ni/Ti compact, dehydrogenation occurring in the Ni/TiH2 compact leads to less densification, yet higher chemical homogenization, after high-temperature sintering but not in the case of low-temperature sintering[15].

*   **Alloying Elements:** The addition of alloying elements can significantly influence the phase transformation behavior of NiTi alloys[6][12][13]. For example, the addition of 1 wt.% of TiH2 to NiTi prealloyed powder shows no notorious difference in the observed phases (NiTi, NiTi2, and Ni3Ti) compared to the powder without TiH2[5]. The properties of monolithic nickel titanium (TiNi) alloys can be effectively controlled by varying the content of nickel in the TiNi phase within the concentration range (48÷51.5) at%[6][13]. In reaction-sintered porous TiNi alloys, a much more pronounced effect can be achieved using various doping additives[6][13].

**2. Specific Phase Transformations in NiTi Alloys:**

*   **Austenite (B2) ↔ Martensite (B19', B19):** This is the primary phase transformation responsible for the shape memory effect and superelasticity in NiTi alloys[10][30]. The shape memory effects (SMEs) of NiTi alloys relate to the transformation of solid-state phases from the austenite cubic B2 structure to martensitic monoclinic B19 structure[10][30].

*   **R-Phase Transformation:** The R-phase is an intermediate phase that can form in NiTi alloys, particularly under stress or with certain alloying additions[23][27]. The presence of the Ni4Ti3 precipitates can suppress the occurrence of martensitic transformation and thus facilitates the formation of R phase[23]. The temperature at point Ms decreases more rapidly in amorphous TiNi-YNi samples than in crystalline ones[26].

*   **Precipitation of Secondary Phases:** During sintering, secondary phases such as Ti2Ni, Ni3Ti, and others can form, depending on the sintering conditions and alloy composition[4][5][19]. The formation of Ni3Ti contributes to the porosity evolution during reactive sintering production of NiTi alloy[31]. The sintered porous alloy has 26.9% open porosity and exhibits volumetric shrinkage[24]. The predominant phase identified in the produced NiTi alloys sintered at 1373 K is B2 NiTi phase with the presence of other minor phases[24].

**3. Influence of Sintering on Phase Transformation:**

*   **Control of Phase Composition:** Sintering allows for the control of the phase composition of the final NiTi alloy by manipulating the sintering temperature, time, and other parameters[4][19]. The phase composition heterogeneity of the RS alloy is the result of insufficient completeness of the reaction behaviour during a synthesis[18].

*   **Elimination of Impurities:** Sintering can help eliminate impurities and reduce the oxygen content, which can improve the properties of the NiTi alloy[17]. The influence of Ti powder purity on phase evolution during the reactive sintering of elemental Ni and Ti powders to form NiTi was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and in-situ neutron diffraction[17].

*   **Grain Size Control:** Sintering can influence the grain size of the NiTi alloy, which can affect its mechanical properties and phase transformation behavior[16]. The anal. on the first five reflections clarifies the non-existence of any order-disorder transition in the NiTi phase from B2-to-BCC structure[16].

*   **Stress Relief:** Sintering can help relieve internal stresses that may have been introduced during the powder compaction process[16].

*   **Enhanced Densification:** Sintering can increase the density of the NiTi alloy by promoting the bonding of the powder particles[15]. The sintered porous alloys have open porosities ranging from 2.7% to 36.0%[28]. In comparison to the Ni/Ti compact, dehydrogenation occurring in the Ni/TiH2 compact leads to less densification yet higher chem. homogenization only after high-temperature sintering[28].

*   **Improved Homogeneity:** Sintering can improve the homogeneity of the NiTi alloy by promoting the diffusion of the elements[15].
