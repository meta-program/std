# Root-Analog Dental Implant Embodiments Breakdown

## Overview of Embodiments

The patent describes several key embodiments of root-analog dental implants and the systems, devices, and methods for designing and manufacturing them. The core innovation involves implants that mimic the shape of natural tooth roots, using additive manufacturing techniques, and can often be placed directly into an unmodified alveolar socket.

## Primary Embodiment Categories

### 1. Core Structural Configurations
- **Central Core Structure**: 
  - A solid or mostly solid central core provides mechanical strength and support for the implant
  - The core can have varying levels of solidity, with more voids in the outer sections and denser material towards the center
  - The core can have a curvature that differs from the outer surface, allowing for a thicker porous shell in some areas
  - The core can be designed with struts (protruding features) to improve mechanical strength
  - Example: A core with a solid circumferential shell and varying solidity in the central section

- **Strut Configurations**:
  - Struts can be vertically oriented, horizontally oriented, spirally oriented, zig-zag, or wavy
  - Struts can have various cross-sectional shapes, including I-beams, triangles, or other protruding features
  - Struts can protrude into the porous surface and can vary in height along the implant's length
  - Example: Vertically oriented struts with triangular cross-sections

### 2. Porous Surface Configurations
- **Porous Surface Purpose**: To facilitate osseointegration, reduce stress on surrounding bone, and provide better engagement between the implant and bone
- **Porous Surface Design**:
  - Can be a lattice-like structure with overlapping elements
  - Elements can be interconnected and textured with dimples or holes
  - The porous surface can cover the struts
  - Thickness can vary along the length of the core
