**1. Paraffin Waxes:**

*   **Description:** Paraffin waxes are petroleum-derived waxes with a melting point range of 52-56°C[20]. They are commonly used in defoamer formulations due to their hydrophobic nature and ability to form a physical barrier between air and liquid, disrupting foam stability.
*   **Examples:** Slack waxes obtained from dewaxing hydrocarbon oils[27], synthetic waxes like Fischer-Tropsch waxes[27].
*   **Applications:** Used in oil-based and water-based defoamers[8]. Paraffin waxes are often used in combination with other waxes or hydrophobic particles to enhance defoaming efficiency[13]. They are also used in the production of hydrophobic silica, where they can be coated onto silica particles to improve hydrophobicity[4].

**2. Natural Waxes:**

*   **Description:** Natural waxes are derived from plants or animals and have a wide range of melting points and chemical compositions. They are often chosen for their renewable nature and biodegradability.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Carnauba Wax:** Derived from the leaves of the Copernicia prunifera palm tree, carnauba wax has a high melting point (83-86°C)[20] and is known for its hard, brittle texture. It is used in defoamers for its hydrophobic properties and ability to form a durable film[22].
    *   **Beeswax:** A natural wax produced by bees, beeswax has a melting point of up to 62-65°C[20]. It is used in defoamers for its emulsifying properties and ability to stabilize foam[23].
    *   **Candelilla Wax:** Derived from the leaves of the Candelilla plant, candelilla wax has a melting point of 68-73°C. It is used in defoamers for its hydrophobic properties and ability to form a flexible film.
    *   **Rice Bran Wax:** A natural wax derived from rice bran oil, rice bran wax has a higher melting point and wider melting range than many other natural waxes[24]. It is used in defoamers for its hydrophobic properties and ability to form a stable emulsion[24].
    *   **Other Natural Waxes:** Includes waxes like sugar wax, rice wax, vegetable wax, Japan wax, Urushi wax, sugar cane wax, palm wax, insect wax, spermaceti wax, shellac wax, and lanolin wax[6].

**3. Synthetic Waxes:**

*   **Description:** Synthetic waxes are man-made waxes that can be tailored to have specific properties, such as a specific melting point or hydrophobicity.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Polyethylene Waxes:** These waxes are derived from polyethylene and have a wide range of melting points. They are used in defoamers for their hydrophobic properties and ability to form a flexible film[16].
    *   **Polypropylene Waxes:** These waxes are derived from polypropylene and have a wide range of melting points. They are used in defoamers for their hydrophobic properties and ability to form a flexible film[21].
    *   **Fischer-Tropsch Waxes:** These waxes are produced through the Fischer-Tropsch process and have a wide range of melting points. They are used in defoamers for their hydrophobic properties and ability to form a stable film[32].

**4. Ester Waxes:**

*   **Description:** Ester waxes are formed by the reaction of a fatty acid with an alcohol. They have a wide range of melting points and can be tailored to have specific properties.
*   **Examples:** Ester waxes can be derived from fatty acids and alcohols with at least 22 carbon atoms[16]. They are used in defoamers for their hydrophobic properties and ability to form a stable film.

**5. Fatty Alcohol Waxes:**

*   **Description:** Fatty alcohol waxes are derived from fatty alcohols, which are long-chain alcohols. They have a wide range of melting points and can be tailored to have specific properties.
*   **Examples:** Fatty alcohol waxes can be derived from fatty alcohols with 12 to 22 carbon atoms[16]. They are used in defoamers for their hydrophobic properties and ability to form a stable film.

**6. Fatty Acid Waxes:**

*   **Description:** Fatty acid waxes are derived from fatty acids, which are long-chain carboxylic acids. They have a wide range of melting points and can be tailored to have specific properties.
*   **Examples:** Fatty acid waxes can be derived from fatty acids with 12 to 22 carbon atoms[16]. They are used in defoamers for their hydrophobic properties and ability to form a stable film.

**7. Diamides:**

*   **Description:** Diamides are compounds containing two amide groups. They are often used in defoamers for their hydrophobic properties and ability to form a stable film.
*   **Examples:** Ethylene bis-stearamide (EBS) is a commonly used diamide in defoamers[5]. It is a very hydrophobic molecule that can have deposition potential if not formulated and used correctly[5].

**8. Metal Soaps:**

*   **Description:** Metal soaps are salts of fatty acids. They are often used in defoamers for their hydrophobic properties and ability to form a stable film.
*   **Examples:** Metal soaps can be derived from fatty acids and metals like sodium, potassium, or calcium[1]. They are used in defoamers for their hydrophobic properties and ability to form a stable film.

**9. Hydrophobic Silica:**

*   **Description:** Hydrophobic silica is silica that has been treated to make it hydrophobic. It is often used in defoamers as a hydrophobic particle to disrupt foam stability.
*   **Examples:** Hydrophobic silica can be produced by treating silica with a silicone fluid[15]. It is used in defoamers for its hydrophobic properties and ability to form a stable film[4][11][15][18][31].
