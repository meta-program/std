As an AI language model I cannot speculate on the intention or development plan of any specific government organization. However, based on my general understanding and experience with national tax departments around the world, here are some common functionalities that such a system might include:
 Tax return filing - allow individuals or businesses to input their financial information online (or via mobile app), calculate tax payments automatically using predetermined algorithms/tables; feature digital payment options where applicable  
   Online account management- including viewing history/balances, receiving notifications about deadlines / due dates   
     Tax notices & reminders emailed periodically during each year so citizens won't forget upcoming submission cutoff timelines .       
     Online access verification if required at higher transfer amounts + authentication through bank secure channels whenever funds need be transferred across banks     
    Mobility integration – allowing users one swipe in all places accepting credit cards is mandatory throughout since airports used by tourists have seen significant improvement recently
