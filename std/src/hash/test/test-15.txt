The report "Poland: Zinc Oxide and Peroxide; Titanium Oxides 2014-2024" provides a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of macroeconomic shocks on the demand and pricing of zinc oxide and peroxide in Poland over the next five years[1]. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key points:

1. **Quantitative Modeling and Forecasting**: The report employs quantitative models to analyze historical data on demand, supply, and prices, and to forecast these variables for the next five years[1]. This includes the impact of macroeconomic shocks at both national and international levels[1].

2. **Central Scenario and Confidence Intervals**: The report presents the results of the estimates from the central scenario, which includes the impact of macroeconomic shocks[1]. The forecasts are accompanied by confidence intervals of ± 95%, providing a range of possible outcomes and indicating the level of uncertainty in the projections[1].

3. **Historical Analysis**: The report documents the historical analysis in terms of quantitative modeling of data, which helps in reaching the most hidden conclusions about the market's past performance[1]. This historical perspective is crucial for understanding how macroeconomic factors have influenced the market in the past and for making informed predictions about the future.

4. **Supply and Demand Segmentation**: The report segments the analysis of supply and demand into domestic and non-domestic markets (exports and imports)[1]. This segmentation allows for a more detailed examination of how macroeconomic shocks might affect different parts of the market.

5. **Price Analysis**: The report includes a study of the historical evolution of prices, analyzing both the supply and demand parts[1]. This price analysis is essential for understanding how macroeconomic factors can influence the pricing of zinc oxide and peroxide.

6. **Macroeconomic Indicators**: The report emphasizes the importance of evaluating key macroeconomic indicators to get insight into the general trends within the economy[4]. These indicators can include factors like GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates, all of which can impact the demand and pricing of zinc oxide and peroxide.

7. **Regional Analysis**: The report includes an analysis of the demand disseminated at the regional level[1]. This regional analysis can help identify areas within Poland that might be more or less affected by macroeconomic shocks.

In summary, the report provides a robust framework for evaluating the impact of macroeconomic shocks on the demand and pricing of zinc oxide and peroxide in Poland. By combining historical analysis with quantitative modeling and forecasting, and by considering both national and international macroeconomic factors, the report offers valuable insights into the potential effects of economic fluctuations on the market over the next five years.
